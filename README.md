##A Discord bot that looks stunning, but is actually pretty dumb.

Discord description :
>"ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ - Limits access to some rooms according to a message number / score.
>
>ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· - Limite l'accÃ¨s Ã  certains salons selon un nombre / score de messages"

For now, I only upload the main file and the .env file to edit some parameters. You can use it as a template for another bot if you want.

###Requirements

You'll only need 3 things :
  - a Python-compatible OS ( Windows, macOS, any Linux distro, ... ) 
  - a recent version of Python ( >= 3.10 )
  - 3 different libraries :
    - discord.py
    - python-dotenv
    - csv

You can install all the libraries in one go with :
```pip install discord.py python-dotenv "python-dotenv[cli]" csv```

###About the wiki

I'll do the wiki someday, but if you're determinded enough to make a wiki, don't hesitate to contact me by mail : <a link="mailto:"imalonelynerd@gmail.com">imalonelynerd@gmail.com</a>.

###Liscence
  
This bot is under the Unliscence. In other words, do whatever the f*ck you want !
