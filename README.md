## A Discord bot that looks stunning, but is actually pretty dumb.

Discord description :
>"ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ - Limits access to some rooms according to a message number / score.
>
>ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· - Limite l'accÃ¨s Ã  certains salons selon un nombre / score de messages"

For now, I only upload the main file and the .env file to edit some parameters. You can use it as a template for another bot if you want.

### Requirements

You'll only need 3 things :
  - any Python-compatible OS ( Windows, macOS, any Linux distro, ... ) 
  - a recent version of Python ( >= 3.10 )
  - 3 different libraries :
    - discord.py
    - python-dotenv
    - csv

You can install all the libraries in one go with :
```pip install discord.py python-dotenv "python-dotenv[cli]" csv```

### Installation

  - Download the "Files" folder
  - Rename "dotenv.txt" to ".env"
  - Edit the different parameters to your liking
  - Launch the bot :
    - Windows : double-click the bot.py file
    - Linux distro : execute ```python3 path/to/file/bot.py```
    
You also can host the bot on a server/PC, but I won't be able to tell you how.

### About the wiki

I'll do the wiki someday, but if you're determinded enough to make a wiki, don't hesitate to contact me by mail :

### Liscence
  
This bot is under the Unliscence. In other words, do whatever the f*ck you want !
