# Gonta

## A Discord bot for the ones who doesn't want to smack 90 $ for MEE6.

Discord description :
>ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ - Be active, get roles, do more in the server. It's that simple.
>
>ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· - Sois actif, obtiens des rÃ´les, et accÃ¨des Ã  plus de fonctionnalitÃ©s. C'est aussi simple que Ã§a.

For now, I only upload the main file and the config file to edit some parameters. You can use it as a template for another bot if you want.

### Requirements

You'll only need 3 things :
  - node.js
  - 3 libraries :
	  - discord.js
    - process
    - fs

You can install all the libraries in one go with :
```npm i discord.js process fs```

### Installation

  - Download the "gonta-js" folder
  - Edit the different parameters to your liking
  - Launch the bot : ```node bot.js```
    
You also can host the bot on a server/PC, but I won't be able to tell you how.

### About the wiki

I'll do the wiki someday, but if you're determinded enough to make a wiki, don't hesitate to contact me by mail :

### Liscence
  
This bot is under the Unliscence. In other words, do whatever the f*ck you want !
